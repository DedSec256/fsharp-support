module Test

type A() =
    member _.M() = 1
    member x.M1() =
        if true then 
            |x.M()|(0)

------------------------------------------------
0: This expression was expected to have type
    'unit'    
but here has type
    'int'    
QUICKFIXES:
Ignore value
Introduce 'let' binding
